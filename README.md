# AI_For_Healthcare# Chronic Disease Progression Predictor

## Overview
The Chronic Disease Progression Predictor is an AI-powered system designed to forecast disease trajectories for diabetes patients. The system analyzes patient data to predict future health outcomes, enabling earlier interventions and personalized treatment plans.

## Project Goals
- Predict disease progression and complications for diabetic patients
- Stratify patients by risk level to prioritize clinical attention
- Provide explainable AI insights to support clinical decision-making
- Create a user-friendly interface for healthcare providers
- Demonstrate end-to-end ML pipeline development for healthcare applications

## Features
- Machine learning models to predict key clinical outcomes (HbA1c trends, complication risks)
- Time series analysis of patient health metrics
- Risk stratification with confidence intervals
- Interactive visualization of predicted disease trajectories
- Basic NLP processing of clinical notes
- Clinician dashboard for patient monitoring
- Explainable AI components for clinical transparency

## Tech Stack
- **Programming**: Python 3.9+
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
